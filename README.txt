Simple WordPress plugin for up/down voting on posts and comments.

== Description ==

UpDownUpDown provides two template tags for adding up/down voting for any post or comment. Anonymous guest visitors can either be allowed to vote (tracked by ip address) or be denied voting and shown a view-only vote count badge. Votes are registered on the server without refreshing the page.

Fork the Github repo: [https://github.com/davekonopka/updownupdown](https://github.com/davekonopka/updownupdown)

This plugin was initially developed as a project of Wharton Research Data Services.
  
== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder containing the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place the following function calls in your templates, somewhere inside the post or comment loop:
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_post_votes')) { up_down_post_votes( get_the_ID() ); } ?>`
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_comment_votes')) { up_down_comment_votes( get_comment_ID() ); } ?>`
1. Display vote badge display only with no voting by setting the second parameter to false:
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_post_votes')) { up_down_post_votes( get_the_ID(), false ); } ?>`
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_comment_votes')) { up_down_comment_votes( get_comment_ID(), false ); } ?>`
1. Visit the plugin settings page to customize it.
1. If you want sort your comments by total votes, just add this code BEFORE the comment loop on comments.php file:

```
global $wp_query;
$comment_arr = $wp_query->comments; usort($comment_arr, 'comment_comparator');
```

And then add `$comment_arr` to `wp_list_comments` function:

```
wp_list_comments('callback=your_callback_name', $comment_arr);
```

Where `your_callback_name` is the function you use to render your comments.
