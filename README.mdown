# UpDownUpDown #

Simple WordPress plugin for up/down voting on posts and comments.

## Description ##

UpDownUpDown provides two template tags for adding up/down voting for any post or comment for visitors. Non-loggedin users may see a view-only up/down vote count badge without voting buttons or might also be allowed to vote.

This plugin was initially developed as a project of Wharton Research Data Services.
  
## Installation ##

1. Upload the folder containing the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place the following function calls in your templates, somewhere inside the post or comment loop:
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_post_votes')) { up_down_post_votes( get_the_ID() ); } ?>`
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_comment_votes')) { up_down_comment_votes( get_comment_ID() ); } ?>`
1. Display vote badge display only with no voting by setting the second parameter to false:
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_post_votes')) { up_down_post_votes( get_the_ID(), false ); } ?>`
  1. `<?php if(function_exists('up_down_comment_votes')) { up_down_comment_votes( get_comment_ID(), false ); } ?>`

## Screenshots ##

2. This shows a badge in a post with a vote set.
3. This shows a view-only badge that non-logged in users will see or all users will see if voting is disabled via theme function flag.
